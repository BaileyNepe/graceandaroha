      'Jay has played a huge part in raising our two girls through work hours. If you are looking for a loving teacher that treats children with respect and kindness there is no need to look anywhere else. Jay is very knowledgeable in the latest techniques of early childhood development. When youâ€™re unsure as a parent Jay always gives great advice on what to do in trying times. Above all else Jay always brings a sense of calm to everyday which gives further assurance that your children get the best and safest level of care. I highly recommend Jay Fowles at Grace and Aroha Educare.',

      'When meeting Jay, it was evident how passionate she was about childcare. What also shone through was her strong, genuine emphasis on whatâ€™s best for the individual child approach, that she fosters. Sending my little girl to Jayâ€™s at home-based care was an easy decision, one I would make 100 times over. The love and care that Kennedy receives on a daily basis is what I would compare to sending her to a family member. Jay has not only been awesome for Kennedy but the extra support she provides to me as a mum has been priceless. Providing help and support comes second nature to her and I would now happily call her my friend. I would 100% recommend Grace and Aroha to anybody looking for childcare for their children. Kennedy often prefers to go to Jayâ€™s than to stay home with Mum. Thatâ€™s a testament in itself that I made the right choice for my daughter and our family.',

      "As a Mum who just had my second baby, with a fly in, fly out husband - I needed alot of help in the evenings! Jay would come and help me with my newborn and toddler. Anything from bathing, settling, feeding, cleaning bottles or playing trucks with my toddler so I could eat dinner or shower! Jay had a lot of practical advice to offer too, coming from her experience as both a Mum and an educator. Having Jay's help and support for the weeks my husband was away was a huge relief and I am so grateful we were introduced!",

      "Jay offered great information and advice on sleeping but the key was that she helped me see Alex's daily life, naps and nights holistically. By changing how I fed, comforted and even entertained him, I was able to help him self soothe and sleep on his own quite easily. I now have a better understanding of what my baby is capable of on his own and what he needs from his sleep time.",
      " The most important aspect of Jay's help has been giving me confidence in myself as a parent. I am an overthinker and for me, Jay calmed my approach. I asked her one million questions, and she answered them all, but bit by bit I could see that my constant stress and consternation over sleep patterns and nap times was actually a problem, and her slower, gentler approach has destressed me and my baby into more independence for both of us.",

      ' Jay has a wonderful calm nature and a really trusting energy about her. After just a few minutes with her, I knew that she wasnt here to judge our parenting, or make us feel observed, or that anything we were doing was wrong. She just sat with me and wanted to get to know me and our family and some of the areas we felt like we could do with some support in.',
