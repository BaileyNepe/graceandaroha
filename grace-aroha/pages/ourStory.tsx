        <p>Grace & Aroha came to be, after years of dreams and discussion between two friends, Jay and Tamara.</p>
        <p>After working together in a Nursery in 2016, and realising our hopes and ideals for children, whānau and Kaiako were the same, they would regularly talk about these ideas. This
          led
          to them becoming homebased providers. Although now, after 12 months, Tamara’s family have moved to Australia for further work opportunities and Jay has chosen to pursue her dream of
          providing a service to families offering a variety of support during the parenting journey. There is plenty of advice on getting pregnant, antenatal classes which predominantly focus on the
          birth, but what happens when you arrive home with this new precious being who relies solely on you!</p>
        <p>Not everyone is comfortable to share how hard it can be and that it is okay to ask for help. Grace & Aroha come to serve you, lift you up, be a shoulder to lean on, and bring a caring and
          respectful view that sharing knowledge can empower another. There is no one answer to this journey, but there’s certainly nothing like having that champion on your side!</p>
