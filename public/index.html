    <p class="inner-section-margin">At Grace & Aroha Ltd, our approach to care and learning is indeed grace and aroha; we strive to respectfully meet the needs of children and whānau with care and
      love, while recognising the potential each child has and supporting their natural growth and development. Children need to be trusted, to lead, play, explore, grow. Whānau should be supported
      with care as they raise their children. The three underlying principles of our kaupapa are love, care and respect.</p>
    <p class="inner-section-margin">Neuroscience tells us that the brain needs to be in a state of well-being before it can be ready for learning. The warm environment of love and genuine connection
      we model at Grace & Aroha Ltd enhances every child's learning and development. </p>
    <p class="inner-section-margin">When we show respect to children through listening and acknowledging them, their thoughts and feelings, they learn their worth and can begin to understand that
      every person is deserving of respect. We will share our lens of viewing the child in a holistic way, using love, care and respect providing a strong, healthy foundation for them to build all
      other relationships throughout their life. </p>
    <p class="inner-section-margin">We can guide you to understand this Kaupapa so that you gain confidence in your parenting, empower your child to be the confident and competent person they were
      born to be.</p>

          <p>Jay has played a huge part in raising our two girls through work hours. If you are looking for a loving teacher that treats children with respect and kindness there is no need to look
            anywhere else. Jay is very knowledgeable in the latest techniques of early childhood development. When you’re unsure as a parent Jay always gives great advice on what to do in trying
            times. Above all else Jay always brings a sense of calm to everyday which gives further assurance that your children get the best and safest level of care. I highly recommend Jay Fowles at
            Grace and Aroha Educare.</p>
          <em>- Campbell and Candice Upperton</em>

        <div class="carousel-item">
          <p>When meeting Jay, it was evident how passionate she was about childcare. What also shone through was her strong, genuine emphasis on what’s best for the individual child approach, that
            she fosters.
            Sending my little girl to Jay’s at home-based care was an easy decision, one I would make 100 times over. The love and care that Kennedy receives on a daily basis is what I would compare
            to sending her to a family member. Jay has not only been awesome for Kennedy but the extra support she provides to me as a mum has been priceless. Providing help and support comes second
            nature to her and I would now happily call her my friend.
            I would 100% recommend Grace and Aroha to anybody looking for childcare for their children. Kennedy often prefers to go to Jay’s than to stay home with Mum. That’s a testament in itself
            that I made the right choice for my daughter and our family.</p>

        <div class="carousel-item">
          <p>As a Mum who just had my second baby, with a fly in, fly out husband - I needed alot of help in the evenings! Jay would come and help me with my newborn and toddler. Anything from
            bathing,
            settling, feeding, cleaning bottles or playing trucks with my toddler so I could eat dinner or shower! Jay had a lot of practical advice to offer too, coming from her experience as both a
            Mum and an educator. Having Jay's help and support for the weeks my husband was away was a huge relief and I am so grateful we were introduced!</p>
