            <p>As a Mum who just had my second baby, with a fly in, fly out husband - I needed alot of help in the evenings! Jay would come and help me with my newborn
                and toddler. Anything from bathing, settling, feeding, cleaning bottles or playing trucks with my toddler so I could eat dinner or shower! Jay had a lot of practical advice to offer
                too, coming from her experience as both a Mum and an educator. Having Jay's help and support for the weeks my husband was away was a huge relief and I am so grateful we were
                introduced!</p>

            <p>When meeting Jay, it was evident how passionate she was about childcare. What also shone through was her strong, genuine emphasis on what’s best for the individual child approach, that
                she fosters. Sending my little girl to Jay’s at home-based care was an easy decision, one I would make 100 times over. The love and care that Kennedy receives on a daily basis is what
                I would compare to sending her to a family member. Jay has not only been awesome for Kennedy but the extra support she provides to me as a mum has been priceless. Providing help and
                support comes second nature to her and I would now happily call her my friend. I would 100% recommend Grace and Aroha to anybody looking for childcare for their children. Kennedy often
                prefers to go to Jay’s than to stay home with Mum. That’s a testament in itself that I made the right choice for my daughter and our family.</p>

            <p>Jay has played a huge part in raising our two girls through work hours. If you are looking for a loving teacher that treats children with respect and kindness there is no need to look
                anywhere else. Jay is very knowledgeable in the latest techniques of early childhood development. When you’re unsure as a parent Jay always gives great advice on what to do in trying
                times. Above all else Jay always brings a sense of calm to everyday which gives further assurance that your children get the best and safest level of care. I highly recommend Jay

            <p>Over the past year Amber has provided such an amazing support system for our little girl Maia. They have built such a cool relationship and I am so grateful to be able to leave Maia
                with someone I can trust and most of all someone Maia loves spending her days with. Maia lets me know about all the adventures Amber takes her out on, bush walks, down to the park for
                a
                swing and sometimes even baking, coming home with some yummy treats in her lunch box for us to try.</p>
            <p>Maia has needed a little bit of extra medical attention with feeding via her mic-key button and feeding machine, Amber was quick to learn the process and has been a huge support to us
                and Maia through our journey. Leaving Maia with anyone that wasn’t family was definitely a struggle but Amber made the process very easy. We couldn’t be happier with the level of care
                Amber provides and would highly recommend her services to any family looking for child care.</p>

            <p>I was so fortunate to be referred to Jay at Grace and Aroha – I knew as soon as I met her and learnt of their philosophies that that’s where I wanted my son to go. Jay organised a
                meeting with her Kaiako Amber. My impending return to work with a 6-month-old baby was so daunting and I found it so difficult to settle with the concept of potentially placing my son
                into a centre. I felt he was so little and would become so easily overwhelmed and not receive the love and attention I wanted him to have. After meeting Amber and having some trial
                meetings with my then 6-month-old Arthur, I felt comfortable and certain that I wanted her to care for him in her home, over placing him in a centre.</p>
            <p>I was still so incredibly anxious about leaving him and going back to work, but Amber made the transition so smooth, and the anxiety soon faded quickly. Fast forward 6 months, and there
                is nowhere else I would want Arthur to be. The home environment that Amber provides is everything I could ever want for my son. Amber is kind, compassionate, intuitive to the needs of
                my son and her ECE education informs her practice alongside her many positive personal attributes. There have been instances where we have been able to work through challenges
                together; from forming new sleeping habits, to feeding and negotiating Arthurs place in her care alongside 2 other little ones. Amber always steps up to help in whatever capacity she
                is able.</p>
            <p>From my observations Amber is calm and navigates the needs of all her children with ease. She is nurturing, firm but fair, and this makes me feel confident that she will be able to lead
                Arthur as he gets older and support him to be the best little boy he can be. Amber isn’t afraid to ask for help which is hugely important to me as a parent and the collective way in
                which Grace and Aroha work is testament to this. I feel so blessed every day that we have Amber in our lives, and I know that Arthur is receiving that absolute highest level of care –
                without a doubt.</p>

            <p>We are so glad we made the decision to enrol our son in home-based care. We couldn't ask for a better fit for our son and our family with our kaiako Amber. Amber is not only passionate
                but she is kind, caring, gentle natured and empathetic with the children. We love her educational philosophy, the way she interacts with and speaks to all of the children and the
                positive learning environment she has created in the home. We love being able to receive regular updates and photos and are kept well informed and up to date on what the days entail.
                We are so grateful to have Amber looking after our son and highly recommend home-based care.</p>
