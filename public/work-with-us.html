      <p>At the heart of Grace & Aroha and our philosophy are love, care, and respect.</p>
      <p>
        Not only do we strive to respectfully meet the needs of children and whānau with care and love, we believe that the kaiako who work with us deserve to be treated with respect and supported
        throughout all aspects of their time with us. We know that this is a demanding yet rewarding role and we will be here to provide you with ongoing professional learning and development and will
        work in partnership with you.
      </p>
      <p> With a consistent philosophy throughout our organisation and in each home, based strongly in Te Whāriki, RIE, and Pikler, the partnership between us and our Kaiako is strengthened as a
        team working under the same kaupapa.

    <p class="primary_content__padding">We believe government funding should be passed on to kaiako to benefit the needs of the children. This is why we pay our Kaiako an additional $1
      per child per funded hour on top of their minimum hourly rate of $7, an end of year bonus based on worked hours, toy library, help with equipment, playgroup, professional development and
      alternate
      care/relievers wherever possible. </p>

                  Homebased care requires a home that meets the regulations set out by the Ministry of Education. This includes things such as fully fenced section, deck heights, child safety locks,
                  separate sleep areas, minimum play space, safe space for pets when not supervised, to name a few. Our Visiting Teacher will do a pre-home check once you have been accepted as a
                  Kaiako with Grace & Aroha Educare.
                </p>
                <p class="description">
                  Please contact us for a quick look checklist that you can go through yourself to be prepared.
                </p>
                <p class="description"> You must be a qualified (at least Level 4 ECE), and
                  working toward full registration. All family members or regular visitors to your home, plus yourself, must be police vetted. This can take a number of weeks to receive and therefore
                  it is not a quick process to set up as a homebased Kaiako. If you have been considering a change from Centre to homebased, or are coming back to the workforce with your own children,
                  please contact us and have a chat to ascertain your suitability.
                </p>
                <p class="description">All Kaiako who work with Grace & Aroha Educare align themselves with our philosophy. </p>

                  Our overarching vision is to create a collaborative group of Kaiako who want what’s best for children and their families. You will align with our philosophy and become involved in
                  creating a supportive group of kaiako who care and educate small groups of children. We expect this collab to become an amazing team of qualified kaiako, who although will be working
                  autonomously from their home, will also be getting together with each other to provide opportunities for children to make friends and learn amongst others in small groups.
