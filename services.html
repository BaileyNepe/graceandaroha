    <p>We believe that you are the most important person in your child’s life. Our knowledge and wisdom is gained through years of experiencing our own children
      plus many others who have passed through the doors of early childhood centres where we have worked. It is with this insight that we are able to see things clearly and support you through
      times that may be challenging. This can be as a new parent to a newborn or with a toddler who is reaching the desire to be autonomous but still too little to do it alone through to the young
      child who has developed their own opinions and want to let you know all about it. </p>
    <p>Parenting is not a “one size fits all” approach and for this reason we believe that spending time with you in your home, supporting you to see your child through a different lens, creating
      healthy habits, and giving you emotional support is a service we would love to offer. Getting to know you and your child is how solutions can be found to the challenges often faced. </p>
    <p>Although there are some amazing services available already in the Waikato, but it may either be too hard to get a space or it is a short term service. This may
      help some, but not all. </p>
    <p>If you are experiencing any type of struggles, you are not alone! No one tells you that breastfeeding is not always easy, that sleepless nights will leave your brain foggy and that those
      baby blues are completely normal and yet no easier to deal with. Our passion is to help you enjoy those small moments, to see your child as a whole person, and to encourage happy and healthy
      relationships in your family. </p>
    <p>Please send us an email if you, or someone you know, would like some support. As a new service we are offering this to the first couple of mums (or dads) for free. Let us come and meet you
      and chat about your needs.</p>
